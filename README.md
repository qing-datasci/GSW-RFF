## Our work is based on [https://github.com/riakymch/ReproCG#building-reprocg (ReproCG)](https://github.com/hojunkim13/PINNs)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This code has been tested with Pytorch 1.13.1, CUDA 11.7.1, Ubuntu 20.04. However, it would be fine with lower versions as well.
The library versions used are:

```
numpy 1.24.3
scipy 1.10.1
matplotlib 3.7.1
pyDOE 0.3.8
pytorch 1.13.1
```
