# Pytorch Implementation of Physics-informed-Neural-Networks(PINNs) 

PINNs were designed to solve a partial differential equation(PDE) by Raissi et al.  
The loss of PINNs is defined as PDE loss at collocation points and initial condition(IC) loss, boundary condition(BC) loss.
I recommend you to read [this](https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/) for more details.
 
## Getting Started



### Prerequisites
This code has been tested with Pytorch 1.10.0, CUDA 11.5, Window 10. However, it would be fine with lower versions as well.
The library versions used are:
